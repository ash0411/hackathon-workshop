            "Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy.\n",
            "Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge.\n",
            "Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n",
            "Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples.\n",
            "Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples).\n",
            "The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.\n",

            "[2][20] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set.\n",
            "The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\n",
            "The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory.\n",
            "Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms.\n",

            "The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.\n",
            "For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data.\n",

            "If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases.\n",

            "Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.\n",
            "[86] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.\n",
            "[87][88] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.\n",
            "Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.\n",
            "[89][90]\n",
            "Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care.\n",
            "There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines.\n",
            "This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits.\n",
            "For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes.\n",
            "There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these \"greed\" biases are addressed.\n",
